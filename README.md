## Laravel using React as frontend framework

Tutorial from [this](https://blog.pusher.com/react-laravel-application/) site.

### Addendum
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger using [`l5-swagger`](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger) composer package
- Use [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sanctum) for API authentication
- Use [Laravel Gates](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authorization#gates) to restrict access
- Use [API Resources](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent-resources) to return response data
- Use [Form Request](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#form-request-validation) classes to validate the input data
